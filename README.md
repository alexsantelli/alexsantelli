# Hi there, I'm Alex 

## About Me
I'm currently wrapping up my Computer Engineering degree at Concordia University, set to graduate in 2024. My academic journey has been an exciting blend of challenging projects, innovative research, and a deep dive into the complexities of computer systems and software engineering. 

### 👨‍💻 Professional Journey
I've been fortunate to channel my passion for technology into a fulfilling role as a FullStack Developer at [TraderEdge](https://github.com/TraderEdgeApp), where I've honed my skills in React, Node.js, and Express. This experience has not only sharpened my technical abilities but also taught me the importance of building scalable, user-centric solutions.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Java, Python, C++, JavaScript
- **Tools & Others**: Git, Docker, SQL, MongoDB

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Focused on understanding and applying collaborative filtering techniques to develop an innovative AI business trip planner. This app aims to personalize travel suggestions by analyzing patterns in user preferences and behaviors, ensuring that recommendations are highly relevant and tailored to individual needs.
- **App Development**: Beyond AI and collaborative filtering, I'm also sharpening my skills in app development to ensure a seamless, user-friendly interface that complements the sophisticated backend algorithms of our business trip planner.
